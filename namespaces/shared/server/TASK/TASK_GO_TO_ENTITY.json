It could work differently on other entities, didn't try it yet.\r\nExample: TASK::TASK_GO_TO_ENTITY(pedHandle, vehicleHandle, 5000, 4.0, 100, 1073741824, 0)\r\nPed will run towards the vehicle for 5 seconds and stop when time is over or when he gets 4 meters(?) around the vehicle (with duration = -1, the task duration will be ignored).\n```\n\n**This is the server-side RPC native equivalent of the client native [TASK_GO_TO_ENTITY](?\\_0x6A071245EB0D1882).**",
