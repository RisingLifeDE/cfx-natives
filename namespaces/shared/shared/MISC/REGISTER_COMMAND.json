Or if you use a supported chat resource, like the default one provided in the cfx-server-data repository, then you can enter the command in chat by prefixing it with a `/`.\n\nCommands registered using this function can also be executed by resources, using the [`ExecuteCommand` native](#\\_0x561C060B).\n\nThe restricted bool is not used on the client side. Permissions can only be checked on the server side, so if you want to limit your command with an ace permission automatically, make it a server command (by registering it in a server script).\n\n**Example result**:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TaCnG09.png)",
